Hi, myself vinay singhania the cause for this message is to convince why I can be a good representative in the coming event as have good leadership skills to be precise i know how to get the work done from the participants, and by that, i don't mean like the Hitler with a hunter in hand by being humble and being frank and i believe that there is no problem that cannot be sorted by just discussing and working on it as a single team and at last, i would like to say that you wanted to see the how capable is the junior core team that can be done by giving roles to new faces if talking about experience then i would say experienced is gained and not buyed 
Thank You
Regards
